# OpenCV-Image-Capture
📸 Webcam Image Capture in Google Colab (with OpenCV & PIL)

This project demonstrates how to capture images using the webcam in Google Colab and process them with OpenCV, NumPy, and PIL.

🚀 Features

Capture an image directly from your webcam inside Colab

Save the image as .jpg locally

Display the image using PIL

Further image processing supported with OpenCV

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

OpenCV (cv2)

NumPy

PIL (Python Imaging Library)

Google Colab + JavaScript integration

📌 How It Works

Runs a JavaScript function in Colab to access your webcam.

Captures the frame when you click Capture.

Saves the image as photo.jpg (also re-saved as something.jpg).

Displays the final image using PIL.

✅ Output

When you run the above code in Colab:

A webcam preview will open.

Click Capture to take a snapshot.
